KAIST CS220 - Course Project 2021 Spring
===

This repository contains a simple Lambda expression parser as well as type
definitions for Lambda expressions and De Bruijn expressions. Your goal is to
successfully implement lines annotated with `failwith "IMPLEMENT"` to pass all
the unit tests. That is, `dotnet test` should return a success for all cases.

The parser implementation is fully given, so you don't need to fix it. You can
use the parser to construct complex lambda expressions in DU (discriminated
union). Note that you don't need to fullly understand the parsing routine, as it
is not the main part of this project. You can just use it as a black box.
